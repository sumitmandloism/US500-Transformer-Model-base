ES Futures Return Prediction with Transformer Model

Project Overview
This project aims to predict the returns of E-mini S&P 500 (ES) futures using a Transformer-based deep learning model.
The model utilizes OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data at 15-minute intervals to forecast the next candle's return.

 Steps Involved
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Downloaded ES futures data, handled missing values, calculated returns, scaled features, and created sliding windows for time series data.
2. Model Development: Built a Transformer model using TensorFlow 2.14.0 to predict returns.
3. Training and Evaluation: Trained the model with early stopping and learning rate reduction, and evaluated its performance on the test set.
4. Backtesting: Implemented a simple trading strategy based on the model's predictions using Vectorbt.
5. Visualization: Plotted predicted vs. actual returns and the equity curve from backtesting.
6. Saving and Exporting: Saved the trained model, backtest results, and project dependencies.

 How to Run
1. Environment Setup: Ensure all dependencies are installed. Run the setup cells.
2. Data Preparation: Data is fetched using `yfinance`. Ensure a stable internet connection.
3. Model Training: Adjust hyperparameters if necessary and train the model.
4. Evaluation and Backtesting: Review model performance and backtest results.
5. Exporting Results: Download the trained model and backtest results for further analysis.

 Dependencies
- TensorFlow 2.14.0
- yfinance
- vectorbt
- pandas_ta
- matplotlib

 Potential Improvements
- Incorporate additional features like technical indicators.
- Experiment with different window sizes and model architectures.
- Implement more sophisticated trading strategies for backtesting.

  This model is the basic block for OHLCV data conversion into prediction further development needs sophisticated strategy and predefined rules for scaling.
