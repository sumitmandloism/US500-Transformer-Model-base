Requirements:

Model Development
-Use TensorFlow 2.14.0 to build a Transformer-based model suitable for time series data prediction.
-The input features are OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) from 15-minute time frames.
-The output is the predicted return for the next candle.

Data Preparation
-Collected and preprocessed ES futures data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) API dated '2024-03-01',end = '2024-09-30'.
-Handled missing data appropriately (e.g., weekends or holidays without trading).
-Implemented sliding windows for sequence generation to convert time series into input features for the model.
-Normalized the input features (OHLCV) using StandardScaler.

Model Architecture
-Design a Transformer model with key components such as multi-head attention, feedforward layers, and residual connections.
-Experiment with various hyperparameters like:
-Number of layers
-Embedding dimensions
-Attention heads
-Feedforward dimension (FFN)
-Ensure the model structure supports sequential time series processing.
-Training & Optimization

Train the model using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.
-Utilize the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
-Use early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure efficient training.

Backtesting
-Implement backtesting using the Vectorbt library to evaluate the model's predicted signals in a real market context.
-Run the backtest on ES futures data, focusing on:
-Entry and exit signals based on the model's predictions.
-Generate performance metrics such as equity curve, trade distribution, and sensitivity analysis.

Result
-Equity curve
-Trade analysis
